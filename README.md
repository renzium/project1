# Little Lemon Restaurant - React Web Application

## 🎓 Project Overview

This is my **Little Lemon Restaurant** web application - a comprehensive project I built after completing the **Meta Frontend Development Professional Certificate** course on Coursera. This project represents the culmination of my learning journey in modern web development, showcasing the skills and technologies I mastered throughout the course.

### 🚀 What I Learned & Applied

After completing the Meta Frontend Development course, I wanted to build something that would demonstrate my understanding of:
- **React 18** with modern hooks and functional components
- **Responsive web design** principles and CSS Grid/Flexbox
- **Client-side routing** with React Router
- **Component-based architecture** and state management
- **Modern CSS** with custom properties and responsive design
- **Progressive Web App** concepts and best practices

This Little Lemon project is my way of putting theory into practice and creating a real-world restaurant website that I'm proud to showcase.

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd project1
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

- `npm test` - Launches the test runner
- `npm run eject` - Ejects from Create React App (not recommended)

## 🎯 Project Optimization

### Image Management & Performance
This project has been optimized for performance and maintainability:

- **Consolidated Image Structure**: All images are now centralized in `public/images/` for optimal loading
- **Eliminated Duplicates**: Removed duplicate and empty image files that were causing confusion
- **Standardized Naming**: Consistent `.jpg` format for all food images (except social icons)
- **Optimized File Sizes**: Kept only the highest quality versions of each image
- **Proper Asset Organization**: Follows Create React App best practices for static assets

**Before Optimization**: 
- 3 separate image directories (root, src, public)
- Multiple duplicate files with different formats
- Empty 0-byte files causing build issues
- Inconsistent naming conventions

**After Optimization**:
- Single `public/images/` directory
- 30 optimized images with consistent naming
- No duplicates or empty files
- Proper `/images/filename.jpg` reference format

This optimization ensures faster build times, cleaner code, and better performance while maintaining all functionality.
